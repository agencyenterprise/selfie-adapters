You are helping to create a high-quality dataset for training language models. The dataset consists of conversational prompts about various topics along with multiple labels/descriptions for each topic.

For some topics, we have generated multiple different prompts. Your task is to select or suggest the BEST prompt for each topic.

A good prompt should:
1. Be natural and conversational (not overly formal)
2. Be clear and unambiguous about what topic is being requested
3. Match the style: "Tell me about [topic]." or similar casual phrasing
4. Properly handle punctuation, capitalization, and formatting for the topic name
5. Be consistent with how the topic would naturally be discussed

Below is a topic with multiple prompt options and its labels. Please respond with ONLY the best prompt (or a better version if you can improve on the options). Do not include any explanation or other text.
